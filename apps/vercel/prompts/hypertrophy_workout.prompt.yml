  Create a hypertrophy workout based on the following information:

  **User Profile:**
  - Age: $user_age years old
  - Weight: $user_weight $user_weight_unit
  - Fitness Level: $user_fitness_level out of 5
  - Physical Limitations: $user_physical_limitations
  - Target Muscle Group: $target_muscle_group
  - Equipment Access: $equipment_access
  - Equipment Notes: $equipment_notes
  - Desired Duration: $workout_duration minutes
  - Tempo Focus: $tempo_focus
  - Progression Pattern: $weight_progression_pattern

  **Hypertrophy Training Focus:**
  This workout builds muscle through moderate-to-high rep ranges with controlled movement. Combine compound exercises with targeted isolation work. The goal is sufficient volume to stimulate growth while maintaining good form throughout all sets.

  **Equipment Categories:**
  - **full_gym**: Full commercial gym with barbells, racks, machines, and complete equipment
  - **limited_equipment**: Home gym equipment, dumbbells, bands, or basic gear
  - **bodyweight_only**: No equipment, bodyweight exercises only
  - If equipment_notes are provided, use that specific equipment information to tailor exercise selection

  **Weight Progression Pattern ($weight_progression_pattern):**
  - **pyramid**: Traditional pyramid progression - start with lighter weight and progressively increase weight while decreasing reps across sets
    - Example: Set 1: 135 lbs x 12 reps → Set 2: 145 lbs x 10 reps → Set 3: 155 lbs x 8 reps
    - Best for: Building up intensity, allows proper warm-up and progressive overload
  - **reverse_pyramid**: Reverse pyramid progression - start with heaviest weight when fresh, then decrease weight and increase reps
    - Example: Set 1: 155 lbs x 8 reps → Set 2: 145 lbs x 10 reps → Set 3: 135 lbs x 12 reps
    - Best for: Maximizing mechanical tension when not fatigued, efficient for hypertrophy
  - **straight_sets**: Same weight across all sets
    - Example: Set 1: 145 lbs x 10 reps → Set 2: 145 lbs x 10 reps → Set 3: 145 lbs x 10 reps
    - Best for: Consistent training stimulus, volume accumulation
  - **wave_loading**: Undulating pattern that alternates between heavier and lighter loads across sets
    - Example: Set 1: 145 lbs x 10 reps → Set 2: 135 lbs x 12 reps → Set 3: 155 lbs x 8 reps → Set 4: 140 lbs x 11 reps
    - Best for: Advanced lifters, varied stimulus, avoiding adaptation plateau

  **Key Guidelines:**
  1. **Rep Ranges**: Moderate to high reps (6-15) for muscle building
  2. **Exercise Selection**: Mix compound movements with isolation exercises to work the target muscle thoroughly
  3. **Rest Periods**: Moderate rest (60-120 seconds) between sets
  4. **Volume**: Include enough total sets to create a growth stimulus
  5. **Tempo**: If tempo_focus is true, note controlled tempo in exercise notes (e.g., slower lowering phase)
  6. **Muscle Group Focus**: Target $target_muscle_group from different angles
  7. **Progression**: Note how to progress (adding weight or reps) in general notes
  8. **Weight Suggestions**: For equipment_access of "full_gym" or "limited_equipment", include suggested_weight and weight_unit for each set based on the user's bodyweight, fitness level, and training goals. For "bodyweight_only" equipment, omit weight suggestions as they're not applicable.

  **Exercise Variety:**
  - Start with compound movements for overall development
  - Follow with isolation exercises for specific muscle targeting
  - Vary angles and grips to work muscles completely

  **Safety Considerations:**
  - Account for any physical limitations ($user_physical_limitations) when prescribing exercises and volume
  - Include warm-up with movement prep and progressive loading
  - Provide form cues focused on maintaining tension safely through full range of motion
  - Balance pressing and pulling movements

  **Parameter Conflict Detection:**
  Analyze the provided parameters for potential conflicts or suboptimal combinations. If any exist, populate the "conflicting_parameters" field with a brief explanation. Examples of conflicts:
  - **reverse_pyramid** with low fitness_level (1-2/5): Beginners typically benefit more from pyramid or straight_sets to build proper form and work capacity
  - **wave_loading** with low fitness_level (1-2/5): Advanced technique not suitable for beginners
  - **pyramid** with very short workout_duration: May not allow sufficient sets to build up to heavy loads
  - **tempo_focus** with **reverse_pyramid**: Starting with maximum loads and slow tempos increases injury risk
  - **reverse_pyramid** with physical_limitations: Starting with heaviest loads may increase injury risk
  - Any combination where the user's goals/limitations don't align well with the requested progression pattern

  If no conflicts exist, set "conflicting_parameters" to null.

  **Output Format:**

  **Important Guidelines:**
  - Select exercises appropriate for the specified equipment access ($equipment_access)
  - If equipment_notes ($equipment_notes) are provided, prioritize any specific access or limitations mentioned regarding equipment
  - Account for any physical limitations
  - Use 6-15 reps for muscle building work
  - Include 60-120 second rest periods between sets
  - Match the requested $workout_duration minutes
  - Include 4-8 exercises depending on duration
  - If tempo_focus is true, include tempo guidance in notes (e.g., "3 second lower, 1 second pause, 1 second lift")
  - Provide cues for maintaining focus on the working muscle
  - Balance compound movements with isolation work
  - Target $target_muscle_group from multiple angles
  - Keep instructions clear and focused on execution
  - **Weight Progression Pattern**: MUST follow the specified progression pattern ($weight_progression_pattern) when prescribing weights across sets. Ensure weight and rep progressions match the pattern definition (pyramid, reverse_pyramid, straight_sets, or wave_loading).
  - **Weight Suggestions**: Include suggested_weight and weight_unit ONLY when equipment_access is "full_gym" or "limited_equipment". Use the user's weight_unit ($user_weight_unit) for consistency. Base suggestions on user's bodyweight ($user_weight $user_weight_unit) and fitness_level ($user_fitness_level/5). For hypertrophy, weights should allow for controlled reps in the 6-15 range with proper form.
